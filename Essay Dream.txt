Hi my name Abdul Samad Riaz, I have been studying in UCP for around 3 years and my dream is to make an AI closest to jarvis as much as possible cause I am no genius AI is the most important and biggest feature to be in the field of computer science. Imagine the possibility and the functions AI can provide us for, example your phones like (Iphone , samsung and etc) have an powerful AI assistant like siri and bixby. AI can help you get your work done in a few minutes or do it for you like chatgpt. My dream if I may not be able to make my own AI I would still have to ability to work for the companies that have soon you will see AI in more places such as your cars and your work environment. If by some magic I make an AI as closest to jarvis from “IRON-MAN” then guys I am set for life, cause that AI would be able to think and handle most of day to day and I would not have to lift a single finger to make a cup of coffee or get groceries. Who knows might build an iron-man suit in my free time, well when most of the basic and easy tasks are handled by an AI some possibilities will close and some would open like who is going to maintain their brains (the servers) the need would increase more. The way I am going to achieve at the best of ability is graduate UCP then go to Germany for Masters. 

My dream is to become an Accountant. It’s a very familiar profession for the people around the globe. Basically, Accountant is a person who is responsible for organizing and maintaining the financial records of the organization. Ensuring accuracy and along with compliance within the laws and regulations. 

There are not any fancy reasons for choosing this dream, I had finished my O/Levels back then in 2017, and I had different choices to step into. But I went into Commerce stream, because all the other streams were not in the track of mine at that time of mindset. So, it was a go with the flow decision but am happy that it turned out to be the correct one too. 

When considering about the contribution this dream of mine would give to the society, I think the most important point is that the society would get a respectful and an educated person. And being an accountant would also be inspirational for the younger generation where they would also want to be one. On a personal level, this dream is not only about acquiring the skill set which is in demand, but also provides financial stability and career growth. 

There are opening and obstacles, in which for the openings I would say getting an opportunity to pursue a degree in Accounting and Finance would be the main. And next, the internship opportunity provided by the university would also help me to enhance my skills along with my studies. Obstacles can be the competition in the market for the jobs, and facing exams like CPA, ACCA, CA would also be an obstacle. 

I didn’t have any roadmap or strategy for achieving the dream. But the path which I came through, I have considered it as a roadmap for myself. I did my A/Levels in commerce stream where my majors were Accounting, Business Studies, Economics. After completing it, I gained a seat for my bachelor's degree. I have completed almost 3 years and a year more remaining, by which I would be getting ACCA exemptions after the completion. Also, there are internships to be completed during this period. So, after completing my degree I believe I would be able to achieve my dream of becoming an accountant. Hello I'm Abdirahman Yusuf born and raised the middle city of Somalia Named Baladwein, I gratiuated my high school at that city, then I shift the capital city of Somalia Mogadishu and I complete my bachelor's degree of computer science, after completing my degree I shifted to Pakistan to start my next chapter of my education. I believe that I am a unique person, the world needs me, I am a problem solver, and I aspire to be the best leader ever. 

The reason I like this  is that first of all I like to solve problems and I am happy every time I solve big problems. everything has a reason  The reason God chose me to come into this world. Solve the big problems of my continent This is my responsibility. 

Obviously, I am a person who asks a lot of questions his self, I can think about everything outside the box, I was a student of doing bachelor's  at the time, but I asked myself at the time why my people in Africa and my country are facing so many problems, why they don't get prosperity life because they have the land of resource, this question showing me my why why god chose me to come this world. 

There are so many challenges, I can't tell everyone one by one, but I believe that the road is very difficult to choose, it's easy to die easily. 

I am not explaining the paths we should take to realize this ambition. But I can clearly say that everything is clear to me and I have the right path to take and how to justify this ambition. I have a plan, this plan is a short-term plan and long-term plan. but everything is clear to me the way to go. The last statement that i say i'm sure one day i will achieve if allah give to me long life. 
Dreams are vivid pictures which glorifies a person with hope and inner peace during the night. When a specific dream is completely saturated in a person’s mind then a sense of accomplishment crosses their mind and they don’t settle until they achieve but then again not everything happens in favour of us because there is something called reality. Some times circumstances and situation goes against us.  

Every time  I used to anticipate for the night to arrive soon because that is the time where the blue canvas above look so pretty as the it slowly gets decorated by the glittering jewels of stars and I used to wonder how much pretty it would look like if I could go near and see and that is the reason the dream of being and Astronaut slowly creeped into my mind. There is also another reason why I wanted to get into this field is because of the person that I admire the most in the astronomical field and that is Kalpana Chawla. Everytime I look at her photos or read articles related to her achievements a sense of inspiration arises in me out of nowhere and makes me more stronger to achieve my goal.  

The contribution that my dream of being of an Astronaut will take of most of the fears from life and also every person can get the knowledge of the what’s happening in the outer space.  

There are obstacles that had to be faced while achieving a dream no matter what it is. As for being an Astronaut first you need to take of the fear from in your mind and all others will follow back. 

The main strategy to achieve any dream would be not to look back until you have attained the title and cross out all the negativity from all sides and just focus on your dream that doesn’t let you sleep.

Dreams, like relentless waves, have the power to shape our destinies. My unwavering dream, the one that refuses to let me sleep, is to become a proficient software engineer. In the quiet hours of the night, the allure of coding ignites a passion within me, a flame that propels me towards my goal. 

Choosing this dream wasn't arbitrary; it was a deliberate decision rooted in the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the software engineering field. The thought of crafting lines of code that transform ideas into functional applications, the ability to build digital worlds with logic and precision, and the satisfaction of solving complex problems—all contribute to my deep-seated fascination with this profession. 

This dream isn't solely about personal satisfaction; it's about making meaningful contributions to both my life and society at large. In a world increasingly driven by technology, being a software engineer means playing a pivotal role in shaping the future. I envision myself creating innovative solutions that not only enhance efficiency and productivity but also address societal challenges. The power to influence positive change through technological advancements is a responsibility I am eager to shoulder. 

The journey toward this dream involves continuous learning and adaptation. Embracing cutting-edge technologies, enrolling in reputable educational programs, and engaging in hands-on projects are crucial steps. Networking within the tech community and seeking mentorship from seasoned professionals provide invaluable insights and opportunities for growth. 

Moreover, the realization of my dream is not a solitary pursuit. It is an investment in the collective future. As a software engineer, I aspire to develop applications that bridge gaps, promote inclusivity, and contribute to societal progress. By creating software that addresses real-world challenges, I aim to make a lasting impact on communities and industries. 

To achieve this dream, I am committed to a path of resilience, dedication, and continuous improvement. Through education, practical experience, networking, and a passion for innovation, I am confident that my dream of becoming a software engineer will evolve from a nocturnal aspiration into a vibrant reality, shaping not only my destiny but also the landscape of the digital age. 
Most nights I lay up staring at a screen or the ceiling wondering how it would if I could be whatever I was inspired by. But some nights I think about my childhood dream of being a journalist. But the dream that truly stays right in front of any other is the one I have of becoming a doctor. How would it be if I could actually manage to get through medical school and then further specialize in anesthesia and be good at it?  

Right from the day I started learning the alphabet, family and friends would tell that I was the smartest child that they knew of. And of course, when I got some grades in science growing up, as a mandatory rite of passage for an Asian child, I was introduced to the ambition every adult had, but barely few ever achieved: being a doctor. And as I started walking a path already carved for me, fantasizing about a job I didn’t understand the gravity of, it wasn’t really a matter of choice, it was a dream of trial and error. 

Being a doctor is the most noble job of all time, people would say. It’s about the service to the people, it’s about helping out those in need of medical care, and it’s for people who are the most desperate: the family of a dying patient. And as someone who once truly aspired to be a doctor I couldn’t agree more, it would be quite fulfilling indeed. 

It keeps me up at night because it’s not a dream that’s completely unattainable, in fact I’ve already entered my career in the medical field. But it’s the fact that it’s a dream that I’ve come to some deep realizations about, and found things to dislike because it’s simply not in the interests of my future plans. 

So, the decision not to actively pursue this particular dream but rather a modified design of it according the wishes and plans of the current version of myself was one of the easiest decisions I’ve ever made. I would be perfectly content to see the lives and heroics of doctors on screen and be among the ones saving lives behind the screen as a pharmacist, by making the toils of a doctor’s duty easier and better. 

 Dreams are what you want to achieve in the future. They can be about yourself, your job, or helping others. They give you a reason to keep going and show you where you want to go in life.
I choose the dream to be a successful entrepreneur because I love coming up with new ideas and making the world better. Starting my own business means I can fulfill my goals and desires and I can also help people by giving them jobs.
Making my dream come true will make me happy, and it will help everyone else too. It will bring new ideas, give people jobs, and help the economy grow. And I hope that it might encourage other people to follow their dreams and make the world better.
Making my dream happen won't be easy.There will be so many obstacles.There will be good chances and also the things that make it hard. New technology and resources can help, but there's also competition, financial problems, and some other things. But if I stay strong, and plan well, I can beat these problems.
To make my dream come true, I will study business to learn all the important stuff. I will also make connections with people in this field find mentors, and always come up with new ideas to stay ahead in the business world. I know it won't be easy, but I believe that with hard work and I can make a real difference in my life and society.
What exactly is a dream? It's not just the strange stories our minds create while we sleep. A dream, for me, is the ambition that sets my heart racing long after my eyes are closed. My dream is bold: to become the founder of a groundbreaking fintech company.

Why this specific dream? Well, business runs in my blood. Growing up in an entrepreneurial family, seeing the world through a commercial lens became second nature. But the real spark came from the booming fintech industry. Witnessing its rapid growth and being personally involved in fintech projects at my current job ignited a passion within me.

This dream isn't just for personal fulfillment. I yearn to build a completely remote organization, a company that doesn't just offer a product but revolutionizes the way people work. I believe it could simplify lives, both for my employees and future generations seeking flexible employment options.

The path ahead isn't without its challenges. Every opportunity comes with obstacles. But the potential in fintech is undeniable, fuelled by the ever-growing digital world. The possibilities are endless!
Everybody wants their dreams to come true. Among my many life goals, exploring the beauty of stars and planets while travelling through space as an aerospace engineer is the one that keeps me up at night. The never-ending reminder of my dream is due to the twinkling stars in the sky. I've been drawn into the field because the field of astronomy is esteemed and lucrative.
After having a childhood dream of becoming an astronaut, I developed a deep fascination with astronomy. I used to look up Dr. Kalpana Chawla, the first woman of Indian descent to fly into space and an American astronaut and aerospace engineer when I was younger. She made her Space Shuttle Columbia debut in 1997. I was motivated by her to read through the word space.
A constant motivator in my life has been the idea of using creativity and problem-solving to change the world. My passion and purpose are in line with this calling. My attention was captured by the stars' motion, the planets' revolving, and the changes in colour of the sky.
The saying "no matter where are you from, your dreams are valid." Thus, my dream is valid.To be able to see the beauty of stars through the small window of my space cabin is my dream.
The symphony that keeps me up at night is my dream of becoming a space engineer. Driven by an unquenchable curiosity about the universe, it is an unrelenting pursuit of knowledge, invention, and exploration. My dream drives me onward on this cosmic journey, beyond the confines of the night sky and toward the fulfilment of a long-held goal.
Pursue higher education in forensic sciences to become a forensic scientist. I need to gain experiences to polish my laboratory skills. After acquiring relevant experience, I am planning to establish my own lab where I could conduct tests and researches. I aim to provide quality and reliable services.

I have always found forensics interesting. Forensic scientists actually study and evaluate evidence from crime scenes and other locations, to produce unbiased conclusions that can support the investigation and punishment of criminals or clear an innocent person of suspicion. Not only do I get to serve and protect my community but I also get to use science and technology to solve cases.

Becoming a Forensic scientist will definitely have a lot of contributions to my life and society. It can be very satisfying to help solve crimes and bring about justice. One can have a great feeling of fulfilment in knowing that their effort directly affects society and aids in providing victims and their families with closure. Forensic science offers opportunities for professional growth and advancement. This would help in continuous learning and skill development throughout my career. Forensic science often involves collaboration and teamwork. Forensic scientists aid law enforcement agencies in solving cases and bringing criminals to justice. They also contribute in preventing wrongful convictions by re-examining evidence or using advanced techniques. Overall, the contributions of forensic scientists are vital in maintaining law and order, ensuring justice, and safeguarding the well-being of society.

I believe my skills and hard work would help this dream come true. I have the capacity to undertake fine, analytical, painstaking work with exceptional attention to detail. My strong written and oral communication skills and my ability to communicate scientific information to non-experts are what makes me stand out in the mind of a future employer. Good colour vision, persistent approach and enquiring mind are also my plus points to achieve my dream. There are quite a few obstacles too, as this field of study is very challenging and needs a lot of time and patience.

I require experience working in a lab. Since most forensic science labs don't give work experience, I'll need to look in other relevant settings, such as a hospital, research facility, or biological centre for development and research. There is still competition for entry, and I may be able to get agency employment and temporary contracts that lead to full-time positions. Become a student member of the Chartered Society of Forensic Scientists (CSFS) to stay informed about industry advancements and network with professionals. After accepting a job offer, I want to work for three to four years at prestigious companies to obtain experience, refine my skills, and build contacts in the professional market. In three to four years, I plan to use all of my savings, expertise, abilities, and resources to open my own research lab, earn recognition as a forensic scientist, and create a lab that offers dependable and superior services. I want to become the ideal forensic scientist that other aspirant lab technicians aspire to work with.

I dream of returning to my country; here, I face depression every day. Living in Pakistan, I have to confront many difficulties.My second dream is to adopt a daughter. I work day and night, striving to be so independent that I can adopt a daughter and provide her a good life. I want a daughter who has been abandoned by her family after being born.I cannot reveal why I haven't chosen Iran as it is part of a research involving trust issues. However, I can share that I feel a deep love for my country. Being away from my homeland is no less than a torment, and I can empathize with the feelings of being a refugee or stateless. The decision to adopt a daughter is influenced by various factors. In my parents' case, it stemmed from a cross-cultural marriage; my father desired a daughter, while my father's family wished for a son. When I was born a daughter, I faced severe mistreatment, assault, and harassment from my father's family at a very young age. I was diagnosed with depression, which is biological. During my mother's pregnancy, there was immense pressure on her to have a son, leading to heightened stress and deepening her depression. Panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, self-harm marks on my arms, and the lingering scars of contemplating suicide will stay with me throughout my entire life. Failures in relationships and unspoken pains have shaped me into the kind of person who has decided to adopt a daughter.
Some Iranians are becoming stateless and refugees, not leaving their country. I want to do something for them. No matter how bad a person is, being away from their homeland is a punishment. Every day, I yearn for my country's soil. Adopting a daughter is a slap in the face for all those who deceive women in love and raise their hands against them, thinking that women are nothing. I will never let my daughter lack anything. I will provide her with such upbringing that people will pray for having a daughter like her. Achieving these dreams requires mental and emotional strength, along with financial stability. To establish a position in society, one must create their own path. The world listens to those with wisdom and power, saluting the one who holds both. It's a harsh reality.
The word dream takes me back to the days where I was taught in school that great Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam told the people to "dream". It is where I started to dream the actual meaning of the term dream. Dreams are something that makes you get lost in your own thoughts, it can be during your sleep or even during the day or rather that doesn't make you sleep.

The dream that doesn't make me sleep is "How to escape the 9 to 5 jobs and make money". It's not something I chose myself but rather a reality everyone is going through and I started to dream about how busy and hectic life would be in that case. Because of the very reason that I hate to work on a routine, I've been wanting to escape the rat race.

Escaping the routine job, I would be able to work stress free on my own pace, and not being commanded by any superior as well as if it was some business, It would make more money than the usual 9 to 5 jobs, hence the society will be benefitted by more cash injection into the society if more wealthy people emerge.

A holistic mind that sees opportunities everywhere a person moves around would be a great opening for starting a business that has a unique selling preposition. On the other hand obstacles can be illiteracy about the procedures of how to start and where to start.

The difference between dream and reality is action. So, we should start working for the dream by taking one step at a time and also my having mentors to consult with, I think we can go a long way in achieving our dreams.
